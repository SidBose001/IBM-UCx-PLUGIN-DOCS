# Jira - Overview

## Overview

The Jira plug-in provides for integration with a Jira server. This plug-in imports Jira issues and saves them as DevOps Velocity issues. Data between the Jira server and the DevOps Velocity server is synchronized every five minutes.

## Compatibility

Must be running DevOps Velocity version 1.2.1 and later to use the plug-in.

## Upgrade notes

Beginning with DevOps Velocity version 2.4.0 users must enter a user access key is required to connect with the DevOps Velocity server. If you are upgrading from a previous version, you must obtain and add the key to the DevOps Velocity configuration property. If the user access key is not added, the integration fails. A proper JQL query must be provided while integration.

## Versions

DevOps Velocity plug-in images are located in DockerHub. To view available versions, see the [UrbanCode DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/urbancode/ucv-ext-jira/tags).

### History

### Version 2.3.24

* **Fix for Custom Field Mapping field**: The update fixes a bug that prevented users from mapping custom field names for Epic Link, Sprint, and Story Points in Jira, ensuring custom names now work correctly. For instance, if the field on your issue in Jira for story points is called Story Point Estimate instead of Story Points, you had no way to import story points. The bug was that the custom mapping did not work and it always assumed the fields were as is (called Epic Link, Sprint, and Story Points) and you could not change this.
