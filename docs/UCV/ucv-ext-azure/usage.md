# Azure DevOps - Usage

To use the Azure DevOps plug-in, the plug-in must be loaded and an instance created before you can configure the plug-in integration. You define configuration properties in the user interface or in a JSON file.

## Integration type

The Azure DevOps plug-in supports scheduled events integration which are listed in the following table.

| Name | Description                                                                                         |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SyncAzureIssuesEvent | Queries the Query Azure DevOps server for new or updated pull requests and commits. |
| SyncAzureGitDataEvent | Queries the Azure DevOps server for new or updated work items. |
| SyncAzureBuildsEvent | Queries the Query Azure DevOps server for build data. |
| SyncAzurePipelines | Queries the Azure DevOps server for deployment data. |
| syncAzureReleaseStatus | Sync Azure Release Status. |

## Integration

There are two methods to integrate the plug-in:

* Using the user interface
* Using a JSON file

The tables in the Configuration properties topic describe the properties used to define the integration.

### Using the user interface

1. From the Plugins page, click **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Plugins**.
2. Under the **Action** column for the plug-in, click **Add Integration**.
3. On the Add Integration page enter values for the fields used to configure the integration and define communication.
4. Click **Save**.

### Using a JSON file

The JSON file contains the information for creating a value stream. Within the JSON file is a section for integrations. It is in this section that plug-in properties can be defined.

1. From a value stream page, download the value stream map. The value stream map is a JSON file used to define integrations.
2. Edit the JSON file to include the plug-in configuration properties.
3. Save and upload the JSON file. This replaces the current JSON file with the new content.
4. View the new integration on the Integrations page.

## Configuration properties

The following tables describe the properties used to configure the integration. Each table contains the field name when using the user interface and the property name when using a JSON file.

* The General Configuration Properties table describes configuration properties used by all plug-in integrations.
* The Azure DevOps Properties table describes the Azure DevOps configuration properties are unique to the Azure DevOps plug-in and define the connection and communication to the Azure DevOps server. When using the JSON method to integrate the plug-in these properties are coded within the `properties` configuration property.
