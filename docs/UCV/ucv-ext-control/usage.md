# IBM DevOps Control - Usage

To use the IBM DevOps Control plug-in, the plug-in must be loaded, and an instance created before you can configure the plug-in integration. You define configuration properties in the user interface or in a JSON file.

## Integration type

The IBM DevOps Control plug-in supports scheduled events integration which are listed in the following table.

| Name | Description | Synchronization Interval |
| --- | --- | --- |
| syncControlPullRequestsEvent | Queries the IBM DevOps Control repository for pull requests. | 5 Minutes |
| syncControlCommitsEvent | Queries the IBM DevOps Control repository for commits. | 5 Minutes |

## Integration

To install the plug-in, perform the following steps:

1. In IBM DevOps Velocity, click **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Available**.
2. In the **Action** column for the IBM DevOps Control plug-in, click **Install**.

There are two methods to integrate the plug-in:

1. Using the user interface
2. Using a JSON file

The tables in the Configuration Properties section describe the properties used to define the integration.

## Integrating the plug-in by using user interface

The tables in the Configuration properties topic describe the properties used to define the integration.

To integrate the plug-in using the user interface, perform the following steps:

1. In IBM DevOps Velocity, click **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Installed**.
2. In the **Action** column for the IBM DevOps Control plug-in, click **Add Integration**
3. On the Add Integration dialog, enter the values for the fields to configure the integration and define communication.
4. Click **Add**.

## Integrating the plug-in by using JSON file

The JSON file contains the information for creating a value stream. Within the JSON file is a section for integrations. It is in this section that plugin properties can be defined. Refer to the JSON sample code in the Configuration Properties section.

To integrate the plug-in using a JSON, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to **value stream page**, and then click the necessary **value stream**.
2. Click  **wrench icon**, and then Select **Edit value stream** to modify the JSON file in the code or tree view editors.
Alternatively, you can also click Download JSON option to download the JSON file, and then select the Import JSON option to upload the revised JSON file.
3. Edit the integration information in the JSON file to add the plug-in configuration properties. Refer to JSON sample code in the Configuration Properties section more details.
4. Click **Save**.

## Minimum permission to integrate with GitHub

The access token generated from IBM DevOps Control server requires the full control of repositories permission to connect to the Control.
## Configuration properties

The following tables describe the properties used to configure the integration. Each table contains the field name when using the user interface and the property name when using a JSON file.

* The General Configuration Properties table describes configuration properties used by all plug-in integrations.
* The IBM DevOps Control Configuration Properties table describes the IBM DevOps Control configuration properties that define the connection and communications with the IBM DevOps Control server.

Some properties might not be displayed in the user interface, to see all properties enable the **Show Hidden Properties** field.

### JSON code example

The following sample code can be used as a template to define the integration within the JSON file for a value stream. Copy and paste the template into the JSON file Integration section and make the appropriate changes.

```json

"integrations":[ {
    "type":"ucv-ext-control",
    "tenant_id":"tenant-id",
    "name":"control-integration-name",
    "properties":{
        "owner":"owner-name",
        "repositories":[ 
            "repo1",
            "repo2",
            "repo3"
        ],
        "apiUrl":"control-api-url",
        "token":"generated-token",
        "ucvAccessKey":"generated-access-key",
        "proxyServer": "*proxy_server_url*",
        "proxyUsername": "*proxy_server_user_name*",
        "proxyPassword": "*proxy_server_password*"
