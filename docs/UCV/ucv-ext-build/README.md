# DevOps Build

DevOps Build plug-in for IBM DevOps Velocity synchronizes projects, build process and build lives from DevOps Deploy. A Build project can be configured as an application in an IBM DevOps Velocity pipeline and Build processes can be configured as an input process in the IBM DevOps Velocity pipeline. The IBM DevOps Velocity pipeline can then display the latest version of the application generated by the build process, enabling visibility into continuous integration activities.
